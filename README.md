# quick-text-processor-
a quick text processor and editor for use by sql database maintainers  
if you frequently work with sql server management studio or MySQL workbench then there has been a time where you wanted to copy a column values, reformat them then include them another sql statement. What i was doing before quick text to was copy the values in excel transpose them horizontally, then copy them in notepad to add a comma or apostrophes through find and replace. Quick text processor eliminates all that in that you can copy and paste into it and it will reformat the text in comma, space or apostrophes. Additional you can remove duplicates from a list of values and compare two column of values to get the values that are in one of the columns but not the other.

its built with python 2.7, wxPython and andrea gavana's wxpython advanced widgets
